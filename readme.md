To have a working copy of this project, run the following command:

```

## Add static tweets to your app

Currently, there's no package to do this, however you're welcome to copy the files and add it to your project! I'll get working on a package soon.

For an example, take a look at the following blog: [rauchg/blog](https://github.com/rauchg/blog/blob/master/pages/2020/2019-in-review.js)
